'The speaker is expressing happiness to be part of a historic demonstration for freedom, referencing the Emancipation Proclamation signed by a great American figure. The proclamation brought hope and joy to millions of enslaved African Americans. However, the speaker acknowledges that one hundred years later, the Negro still faces oppression, segregation, discrimination, and poverty in American society. The demonstration aims to dramatize the ongoing struggle for equality and justice, highlighting the shameful condition of continued inequality and injustice faced by African Americans. The speaker also references the Constitution and Declaration of Independence, pointing out that America has failed to fulfill its promise of guaranteeing the "unalienable Rights" of "Life, Liberty, and the pursuit of Happiness" to all men, including black men. The speaker further criticizes America for giving the Negro people a bad check, symbolizing the failure to fulfill its obligations to its citizens of color.'
